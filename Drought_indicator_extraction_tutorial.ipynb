Any necessary code will only be run once an output is required, such as saving a file out, opening an interactive window, or using the \".getInfo()\" command. When running a cell with GEE, there is an initial check to make sure the syntax of the code is correct but it will not check that variables are compatible. This can make bug fixing challenging as the bug is not necessarily from the currently running cell. As an example, imagine you have four cells with the following dummy code, where f() and g() are arbitrary functions:\n",
