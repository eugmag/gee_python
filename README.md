# Extracting Drought Indicators using Google Earth Engine in Python
 
This repository provides a step-by-step guide for extracting **drought indicators** using **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** in **Python**. The workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook format, which is particularly suited for use in **Google Colab**.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
 
Monitoring and assessing drought conditions is critical for early warning systems and informed decision-making in climate-sensitive sectors. This repository demonstrates how to access and process remote sensing datasets via the Google Earth Engine Python API to derive drought-related indicators efficiently.
 
The notebook in this repository shows:
- How to initialize the Google Earth Engine Python API
- How to access relevant Earth observation datasets for drought monitoring
- How to compute basic drought indicators (e.g., NDVI anomalies, precipitation deficits)
- How to visualize and export the results
